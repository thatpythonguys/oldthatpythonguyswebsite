I have been very inactive in this diary. I invested most of my time
in my notes on Real Analysis and Modern Algebra.
I'll try to publish them soon if I think they are up to standard.

I participated in two different mock AIMEs today, so it's safe
to say that my brain is pretty fried. I won't post any write-ups right now
because neither are finished, but I will link the contests.

The first one I did in the morning was the 
[IMTC contest](https://imtcontest.org/). 
15 questions with 3 hours. I answered 7 of them,
and guessed on 2 more. The first few were quite easy and caused my
confidence to go up until the last few questions, which killed me.

The second contest was the [TTLM contest](https://tothelimitmaths.org/), which I started in the evening. I was more relaxed doing this,
I did not even plan on using paper for anything other than the geo
problems, so I stuck to my whiteboard. I answered 6, and guessed on 1
more. Again, I started to get stuck on some problems. I will also note
that the time on this exam was 2 hours compared to the normal
time period of 3 hours. The questions however seemed easier,
so it seemed to balance out the difficulty of this exam.
